That was my second Qt project — a slightly more advanced one.
I tried to develop the basic structure of a program for cinemas.

The program includes:
1-Ticket Selling
2-Ticket canceling
3-Extras (popcorn,coke, etc.)

1-2 : Ticket Selling/Canceling
When you click the Green button you see the "Seats" screen. 
Grey seats mean they are available, and red seats mean they are sold.
If you click on a grey seat, a new screen appears where you can input the customer’s name and the price of the seat.
If you click on a red seat, the ticket for that seat is canceled.

3: Extras
The other button on the main menu is for Extras. 
When you click it, a purchase screen appears where you can choose items like popcorn, coke, etc.
You can add these extras to the bill for a specific seat.
You can also cancel the extras fee from this screen.
